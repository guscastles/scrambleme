# Text Scrambler - A Teaser For Your Brain

## Abstract
This is a simple application to demonstrate the micro-framework flask. It helps demonstrate how the human brain can easily read a text with scrambled words, as long as the first and last letters of the words are kept in place.

The application has three pages:
* The home page, where you can input the test text
* The results page, where you can see the scrambled test text
* And the *Would you like to know more about your brain?* page, which you give you ten links to articles in the Wikipedia about the brain.


Each of these page is redirected to routers in the file
> web/app.py
by adults in the ABC. I file. t would you like to know more about your brain page is filled after a request to the wiki API with the search said on brain as the keyboardko
