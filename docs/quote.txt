The with clause was introduced with SQL:1999 as a set of optional features. Leaving the recursive
variant aside, the features are T121 for top-level with clauses and T122 for with clauses in
subqueries.

The basic functionality of with is well-supported.
The single area where products behave differently is name resolution. It is especially
noteworthy that with is often treated like with recursive. The more subtle incompatibilities
are related to qualified table names (schema.table cannot refer to a with query)
and views used in the scope of with queries
(the query inside the view does not “see” the outer with clause).
